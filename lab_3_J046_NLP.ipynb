    "Ambiguous Date Formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"Her birthday is on 07/08/1990.\" was correctly parsed, but in the case of \"Submit your report by 08/31/2021.\", it was incorrectly parsed as \"2021/31/08\".\n",
    "Cause: The function may misinterpret month and day positions due to the ambiguity in the formats (MM/DD/YYYY vs. DD/MM/YYYY).\n",
    "Edge Cases in Shortened Year Formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"They got married on 12/12/12.\" returned None. The function might not correctly interpret shortened year formats like \"12\" (meaning 2012).\n",
    "Cause: Lack of logic to handle two-digit years.\n",
    "Ordinal Indicators and Suffixes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"The holiday starts on Dec 20th, 2021.\" was parsed as \"Dec/20/th\".\n",
    "Cause: The regex captures ordinal indicators like \"th\" but fails to handle them properly in the final output.\n",
    "3. Correctly Parsed Dates:\n",
    "The correctly parsed dates mostly involve straightforward and unambiguous formats, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "YYYY-MM-DD formats: \"The deadline is 2022-12-31.\" -> \"31/12/2022\".\n",
    "Day-Month-Year with ordinals: \"We met on 1st of January 2000.\" -> \"01/01/2000\".\n",
    "Dates without ordinals: \"The official exam date is now 2021.11.10.\" -> \"10/11/2021\".\n",
    "These cases demonstrate that the function works well with clear, unambiguous, and common date formats."
